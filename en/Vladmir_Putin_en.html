    <h2>✉️ Open Letter for Peace and Reconciliation</h2>
    <p>
      This letter is born from prayer — from believers across nations who share one hope:
      that swords may be turned into plowshares, and hearts may remember mercy.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.”  
      — Matthew 5:9 (KJV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🌿 A Call to Conscience</h2>
    <p>
      The world is weary of division — East against West, nation against nation, ideology against ideology.
      Yet the Creator made us of one blood and one breath.
      When we forget this, politics becomes idolatry; when we remember, nations can heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us rediscover diplomacy as sacred work — where truth and humility meet,
      and where love disarms the heart before it disarms the armies.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.”  
      — Romans 12:18 (KJV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🤝 The Path Forward — A Faith-Based Accord</h2>
    <p>
      Inspired by the Abraham Accords, which showed that faith need not divide us,
      we propose a renewed <strong>Global Accord of Conscience</strong> —
      a framework where faith leaders, diplomats, and citizens join hands to protect life, family, and creation.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Reconciliation over Revenge:</strong> nations choose forgiveness over pride.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Dialogue over Domination:</strong> every conflict met with conversation, not conquest.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Truth with Transparency:</strong> governments walk in the light, accountable before their people.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Justice with Mercy:</strong> power serves righteousness, not oppression.</li>
      <li><strong>5. Faith with Freedom:</strong> all may worship God without fear or coercion.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee,
      but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?”  
      — Micah 6:8 (KJV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🕊️ To Those in Power</h2>
    <p>
      We appeal to every leader — in East and West, North and South —
      to pause the drums of war and listen for the still, small voice that speaks peace.
      No throne is strong enough to stand on the suffering of children.
      No banner is holy if it waves over the ruins of love.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks:
      nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”  
      — Isaiah 2:4 (KJV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🙏 A Prayer for the Nations</h2>
    <p>
      We pray for Russia and Ukraine, that we begin to love our next, and love each other.
      We pray for Israel and Palestine, for America, Europe, Africa, and Asia —
      that the leaders of these lands may hear the whisper of conscience and the cry of the children, the women, the poor 🙏🏼
      We pray for President Vladimir Putin, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Donald Trump,
      and every statesman burdened with choice:
      May you be guided not by fear, but by wisdom; not by vengeance, but by vision.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.”  
      — James 3:18 (KJV)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>✝️ The Invitation</h2>
    <p>
      Let this be the generation that proves faith can unite where politics divides.
      Let the spirit of the Abraham Accords be rekindled —
      not as a treaty of power, but as a covenant of hearts.
      For true peace is not the absence of conflict, but the presence of justice, humility, and love.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      “And the work of righteousness shall be peace;
      and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.”  
      — Isaiah 32:17 (KJV)
    </blockquote>
